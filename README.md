</p>

A Rust implementation of the [Monkey Programming Language](https://monkeylang.org) implemented in Golang in the [Writing an Interpreter in Go](https://interpreterbook.com) book.
As in the book, everything is written by hand, though there are still many features to implement.

Warnings:

  - WORK ON PROGRESS.

  - This is a toy language, so it is not intended to be fast or optimized, nor used in production.
