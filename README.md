#Monkey Interpreter

A Rust and C++ implementation of the Monkey Programming Language implemented in Golang in the `Writing an interpreter in Go` book.
As in the book, everything is written by hand, though there are still many bugs to fix

The `src` dir is where is written the core in Rust.
The `c_cxx/src` is where is written the C++ part.
It compiles to the `build` directory.
