#Monkey Interpreter

A Rust implementation of the Monkey Programming Language implemented in Golang in the `Writing an interpreter in Go` book.
As in the book, everything is written by hand, though there are still many features to implement.
WORK ON PROGRESS.
Warning: This is a toy language, so it is not intended to be fast or optimized, nor used in production.
